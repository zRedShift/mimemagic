A few ground rules for people interested in adding new mime-types.

* Mime-types used should be IANA registered mime-types when possible
* When old mime-types become registered, the new definition should
  include an alias for the old mime-type
* New entries or modifications should include a test case (see below)
* Mime-types/file formats proprietary to one application should only
  be added to a private .xml file and be bundled with the application
  itself
* Magic offset must be as small as possible. For example, the worst case
  scenario for ISO images is 32k inside the file. This is too big for a sniff
  buffer, especially on remote locations. Avoid those.
* No commits should be done that break the test suite, or the test suite
  test in question should be amended, and reason for the changes clearly
  documented in the commit message

Filing bugs
-----------

Bugs can be filed at:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=shared-mime-info

Bugs for new mime-types should include:
- a patch generated against the current git master, with authorship information
- one or more test files to be added to the test suite

Test suite
----------

You need to have xdgmime checked out [1] and compiled at the same level as
shared-mime-info. ../xdgmime/src/test-mime-data will be run against
tests/list.

The format of the file is:
<testcase filename> <expected mime-type> <expected failures>

The expected failures is whether matching the file with the mime-type would
fail when matched by file, data or name. "x" indicates expected failure, "o"
indicates expected success. Trailing "o"s can be omitted.

See the top of the tests/list file for syntax details.

You can also temporarily print the results of test-mime-data by putting your
test files in the staging-tests/ sub-directory.
